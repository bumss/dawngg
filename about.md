We're mainly focused on mythic progression and our team members hail from all corners of India. We also run high-level mythic keystones, RBGs, & arenas.

Our core team has plenty of mythic progression experience, (mostly) super helpful, and friendly! So everyone, regardless of your experience, is welcome.
